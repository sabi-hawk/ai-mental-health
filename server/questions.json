      "info_section_1_content": "<p>Depression is a persistent mood disorder that affects the way we feel, think, and act; you may experience anxiety, stress, or saddening thoughts with depression. Depression is mainly characterized by profound sadness, lack of motivation, feelings of worthlessness, and loss of interest in pleasurable activities. These are the characteristics that this quiz is testing for. However, this quiz may not be all encompassing, and other aspects of your life may be affecting your depression symptoms and mental health, that this quiz may not be testing for.</p>\r\n<p>As you can probably imagine, depression disorders can impact our personal and professional life profoundly, leading to social isolation, relationship issues, and even medical complications, many people have trouble sleeping with depression. However, with the necessary information and treatment, people with depression can live productive healthy lifestyles with a diagnosis. There are many options for treatment, including therapy, medication, group therapy, and online therapy, each of these may help alleviate symptoms of depression.</p>\r\n<p>Depression and anxiety have a lot in common, which is why it&rsquo;s relatively easy &ndash; especially for laypeople &ndash; to confuse them. They are the two most common mental health or mood disorders that mental health professionals diagnose. Furthermore, depression and anxiety can co-occur, with overlapping symptoms that make it even more difficult for clinicians to separate them. People with anxiety and depression both may voice similar symptoms, like difficulty sleeping, poor mood, lack of energy, and anxious thoughts. However, this quiz tests for the differences in depression and anxiety.</p>\r\n<p>While depression involves persistent sadness and the tendency to ruminate on past events and thoughts, anxiety generates restlessness and persistent worrying.</p>\r\n<p>But to understand why depression can have a devastating impact on our everyday life, we need to look at the signs and symptoms.</p>",

      "info_section_3_title": "How is Depression Treated?",
      "info_section_3_content": "<p>When it comes to treatment options for depression, mental health professionals often resort to medication and/or psychotherapy for depression. In fact, studies suggest that a mix of psychiatric interventions and therapy focused on depression, provides the best possible outcome. With the right treatment plan, anyone with depression or a mental health diagnosis can improve their mood, stress levels, sleeping, thoughts, and more. After this depression quiz, don't be afraid to reach out for the treatment and help you need for depression.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Treatment: Psychotherapy for Depression Symptoms</strong></h3>\r\n<p>In essence, psychotherapy (or &lsquo;talk&rsquo; therapy) helps you get to the bottom of the depression symptoms, understand how depression affects your life, and cultivate healthy habits that will keep your depression at bay.</p>\r\n<p>In general, experts believe therapy is an excellent treatment option for mild forms of depression, and most professionals specialize in depression or have experience working with people who are experiencing depression. When it comes to severe clinical depression, healthcare professionals recommend a psychiatric consultation followed by antidepressant medication to tackle the depression. This balance of treatment medications and therapy can help with the pain of depression while understanding the thoughts and feelings. </p>\r\n<p>Aside from individual therapy, patients with depression can benefit greatly from family and couples therapy. There&rsquo;s also group therapy for depression which brings together people who suffer from the same condition, creating a community that tests and provides mutual support for depression.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Treatment: Medication for Depression Symptoms</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Since depression disorders are caused in part by chemical imbalances in the brain, the use of psychiatric treatments is sometimes the only way patients can get back on their feet, improve sleep, and decrease stress. Depression is treatable with the right care, and a therapist can support you to get the help you need and start feeling more like yourself and less like your depression symptoms.</p>\r\n<h2> Online Therapy for Depression Symptoms </h2> \r\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14px;\"> What are the options for therapy? One valuable way to address symptoms of depression is online therapy or counseling. With therapy online, you can get treatment and improve your mental health or depression from the comfort of your home. On many online services you can receive therapy for depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and most mental health issues. This can be an empowering experience to cultivate a mindset of wellness, and not just focusing on what this quiz addresses: the symptoms of your depression.

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

      "info_section_1_content": "<p>Signs of an anxiety disorder can differ from person to person. Possible symptoms of anxiousness include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Nervousness or restlessness</li>\r\n<li>Feeling tense or on-edge</li>\r\n<li>Rapid heart rate</li>\r\n<li>Hyperventilation</li>\r\n<li>Irritability</li>\r\n<li>Trouble falling or staying asleep</li>\r\n<li>Difficulty concentrating or focusing</li>\r\n<li>Trembling</li>\r\n<li>Sweating&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Weakness or fatigue</li>\r\n<li>Gastrointestinal issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Panic attacks are another common symptom of these disorders. Panic attacks occur when you have a sudden feeling of overwhelming panic and fear. This can cause a racing heart, trouble breathing, chest pain, and dizziness. Panic attacks typically have a specific trigger and the symptoms eventually pass.</p>\r\n<p>Different types of disorders can cause different symptoms. Common types of anxiousness in these disorders include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</strong>, which causes a lasting and out-of-proportion feeling of anxiousness about regular events and activities. Nervousness with this disorder is hard to control and often has physical ramifications. This quiz will identify symptoms of GAD. One place where this may present itself is with test anxiety, where people will experience symptoms while taking tests. Test anxiety can make educational opportunities difficult, or in the professional world test anxiety may pose difficulties for interviews. However, GAD can express itself in any part of life, test anxiety is just one example. &nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Agoraphobia</strong>, which is the fear of places, situations, and events that would be difficult to escape or would make you feel trapped. People with agoraphobia often avoid crowded areas, public transportation, and leaving home in general because it tests their boundaries.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Panic disorder</strong>, or PD, which is characterized by frequent panic attacks that inhibit individuals from engaging in daily activities for fear of triggering an attack.&nbsp;</li>",
      "info_section_2_title": "How is Anxiety Treated?",
      "info_section_2_content": "<p>There are multiple treatment methods available for those who experience symptoms. Patients may opt for a single treatment or a combination of treatments depending on the severity of the anxiousness and their unique needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some cases may be manageable with self-treatment. While this is generally not sufficient for severe disorders or those that have long-lasting feelings of anxiousness, it may be effective for mild cases.</p>\r\n<p>At-home treatment methods for anxious thoughts and feelings may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Meditation, yoga, and deep breathing</li>\r\n<li>A regular exercise routine</li>\r\n<li>Stress management, including scheduled time off from work or school</li>\r\n<li>Talking to a friend or loved one</li>\r\n<li>The practice of trading negative thoughts for positive ones</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Therapy</strong></p>\r\n<p>Therapy is the most common method of treatment for most mental health conditions. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that can be effective in helping people manage and overcome their symptoms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy works to identify and alter triggering thoughts and feelings. In cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, therapists aim to help patients pinpoint distorted thinking and triggers. Over time, patients can identify when their anxious thoughts are out of proportion to the situation at hand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Medications</strong></p>\r\n<p>Medications can also help individuals effectively manage their symptoms. While medications can be successfully used for some management, it&rsquo;s important to avoid dependency. Discuss the potential risks of any new medication with your doctor before taking it.</p>\r\n<p>If you or a loved one are experiencing anxiety symptoms that interfere with daily life, you may be experiencing an anxiety disorder. It's important to note that these disorders are common and treatable.</p>\r\n<h2> Grounding Techniques </h2>\r\n<p> One great tool to take home with you is the idea of grounding. This will help make you aware of the space that surrounds you in a stressful situation and bring you back to a peaceful reality by engaging your senses. This technique asks you to identify 5 items or objects that you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Ideally this will help slow down your mind in a stressful social situation and remind you that you are okay. </p>\r\n<p> With the help of a licensed therapist or counselor, you can empower yourself with techniques to calm your mind and body in triggering situations. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are in crisis or want to learn more about mental health, do not hesitate to call the hotlines below:\r\n\r\n<uI>\r\n<ul class=\"p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet\" data-stringify-type=\"unordered-list\" data-indent=\"0\">\r\n<li>\r\n<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.rainn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.rainn.org/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-46778\">RAINN</a>&nbsp;(Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network) -&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"tel:18006564673\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"tel:18006564673\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-46779\">1-800-656-4673</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-46780\">The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"tel:18002738255\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"tel:18002738255\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-46781\">1-800-273-8255</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.thehotline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.thehotline.org/\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-46782\">National Domestic Violence Hotline</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"tel:18007997233\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"tel:18007997233\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-46783\">1-800-799-7233</a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"https://www.nami.org/find-support/nami-helpline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.nami.org/find-support/nami-helpline\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-46784\">NAMI Helpline</a>&nbsp;(National Alliance on Mental Illness) -&nbsp;<a class=\"c-link\" href=\"tel:18009506264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link=\"tel:18009506264\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" aria-describedby=\"sk-tooltip-46785\">1-800-950-6264</a>, for more information: &nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@nami.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">info@nami.org,</a>&nbsp;or visit their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Nonprofit-Organization/NAMI-National-Alliance-on-Mental-Illness-12959863437/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Facebook Page</a>.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul></p>",

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

As a result of the lack of diagnosis of certain cases, children with an undiagnosed disorder grow into adults who might struggle to hold on to their jobs and relationships.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, many of those who struggle with adult ADHD do not realize that they&rsquo;re dealing with this condition. Furthermore, they are often surprised to find out that the reason why they&rsquo;re having trouble concentrating on tasks is a neurodevelopmental condition that they&rsquo;ll have to deal with for the rest of their life.

      "info_section_3_content": "<article><p>Therapy involves a multidisciplinary approach (psychiatry, neurology, psychology) and the involvement of friends and family members who can provide social support to those with ADHD. With the addition of these treatment methods, people can live a healthy and productive lifestyle while managing their symptoms. </p>\r\n<p>Most experts agree that the best approach to treat adult ADHD is a combination of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy focused on addressing signs and symptoms discussed in the quiz above.</p>\r\n<p><h5>Medication for ADHD Symptoms</h5></p>\r\n<p>Since the disorder is often accompanied by depression or anxiety, psychiatrists can prescribe medication to help patients cope with symptoms and achieve mental balance.</p>\r\n<p>However, a therapeutic approach based solely on medication is not sufficient for adults with the disorder, as medication only diminishes the symptoms, but does not fundamentally change how the brain works. Due to this, most professionals will recommend a combination treatment method to treat the disorder. </p>\r\n<p><h5>Psychotherapy for ADHD Symptoms</h5></p>\r\n<p>Psychotherapy is an extremely useful tool in the treatment of most disorders. Many clinicians believe cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can have a significantly positive effect on adults who have the disorder in terms of gaining valuable organizational and time management skills.</p>\r\n<p>With the help of a counselor or therapist, adults with ADHD can find ways to avoid distractions, control their impulsive decisions associated with it, and cultivate peace of mind through meditation and relaxation techniques.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, if the person is dealing with co-occurring conditions (e.g. bipolar disorder, OCD, anxiety, depression, along with ADHD) then psychotherapy becomes an absolute necessity.</p></article>\r\n<h3> Where to Read More Online about ADHD</h3>\r\n<h3 style=\"font-size:14px;\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/blog/adhd/an-overview-of-common-adhd-symptoms-in-toddlers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What are the Common ADHD Symptoms in Toddlers </a>- <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/blog/adhd/an-overview-of-common-adhd-symptoms-in-toddlers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/blog/adhd/an-overview-of-common-adhd-symptoms-in-toddlers</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/blog/adhd/an-overview-of-the-adhd-types\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">An Overview of ADHD Types </a>- <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/blog/adhd/an-overview-of-the-adhd-types\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/blog/adhd/an-overview-of-the-adhd-types</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/blog/adhd/can-you-grow-out-of-adhd-adhd-and-adulthood\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Can You Grow Out of ADHD?

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

On top of that, those with post-traumatic stress disorder are at risk of developing depression or anxiety.</p>\r\n<h2>Does everyone who Experiences Trauma get PTSD?</h2>\r\n<div>But not all people who survive a traumatic event end up experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Even if your immediate response to a traumatic event is extreme, it&rsquo;s not a sign of mental illness. In fact, it&rsquo;s perfectly normal to have an intense reaction to a potentially traumatic event. The problems and symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder occur when we can&rsquo;t get past the painful memories that might follow. Some symptoms can be identified in this PTSD quiz.</div>\r\n<p>Post traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by three broad categories of problems: involuntary recurrent memories of past trauma, avoidance of trauma-associated stimuli, and persistent hyperactivity and hypervigilance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1 style=\"font-size:15px;\"><li>PTSD Test</li></h1>\r\n<div>This PTSD quiz may identify signs of post traumatic stress in people from all categories. </div>",

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

Those who take the borderline personality disorder test or quiz above and have symptomatic results may experience sudden mood swings, black and white thinking, and difficulties in exercising control over their emotional responses due to the disorder. However, as mentioned, the quiz is not a diagnosis; the quiz identifies potential symptoms and seeking treatment is the next step.</p>\r\n<p>Although this disorder typically occurs during adulthood, there are cases when this disorder can begin to manifest during adolescence. It&rsquo;s also one of the most common personality disorders, affecting 1-2% of the general population.</p>\r\n<p>Since people with BPD may have a hard time keeping their emotions under control, they are often in a state of anger and revolt.</p>\r\n<p>On top of that, their self-image is profoundly distorted, making them feel worthless and fundamentally imperfect. Although they crave human connection and affectionate relationships, those who experience this disorder often fail to cultivate long-term relationships because their anger, impulsivity, and lack of emotional control, can quickly drive people away.</p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, decades of scientific studies have helped mental health professionals gain a better understanding of this disorder and design effective intervention strategies. Current research indicates that, by following proper intervention strategies, people with BPD can enjoy a happy and fulfilled life regardless of the disorder.</p>",

On top of that, this disorder can also be accompanied by other conditions  such as depression, PTSD, and anxiety. While taking a borderline personality disorder test or quiz, be sure to open up about your emotions and how these symptoms have effected you and your mindset. However, be aware that this quiz is examining how you resonate with this disorder in the moment, but the quiz may not be encompassing all potential symptoms.

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

This behavior is often accompanied by intense feelings of guilt and embarrassment linked to excessive eating.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike bulimics, people who struggle with binge eating do not take compensatory measures (e.g. vomiting, laxatives). As a result, many who suffer from binge eating disorder may be overweight and at risk of developing numerous medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bulimia Nervosa</strong> is characterized by frequent episodes of fast consumption of large amounts of food, followed by compensatory behaviors (e.g. laxatives, vomiting, extreme workouts, fasting). This vicious cycle of consuming excessive amounts of food and taking preventive measures to avoid weight gain is done in secret, often generating shame and guilt.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Anorexia Nervosa</strong> is characterized by extreme limitation of food intake coupled with cleansing rituals (e.g. laxatives, vomiting, diuretics). People with anorexia are obsessed with body weight, counting calories, and extreme dieting.

      "info_section_3_content": "<p>Eating disorders are complex conditions that require the involvement of specialists from different fields - counselors, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, and physicians. In other words, there aren&rsquo;t any set-in-stone treatment options that can be applied by a single specialist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since we&rsquo;re dealing with complex disorders that often lead to unique complications for each case, the scientific literature is relatively limited on this topic. However, there are several approaches that experts believe are highly effective in dealing with eating disorders:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Counseling and psychotherapy: </strong>Counseling and psychotherapy are the most common approaches that experts use to treat eating disorders. By exploring the source of the problem and discussing potential strategies to overcome unhealthy eating behaviors, mental health professionals can help the patients/clients change their relationship with food.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Nutrition counseling: </strong>Because of unhealthy eating habits (extreme dieting, fasting), people who struggle with eating disorders are often dealing with vitamin and mineral deficiencies. With the help of nutrition experts, they can gradually adopt healthier eating habits, thus avoiding medical complications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Psychiatric medication: </strong>Since eating disorders are often accompanied by anxiety, depression, and other severe psychological symptoms, some experts believe medication should be a vital part of the treatment plan. Once medication begins to take effect, patients can get a handle on the severe psychological consequences of eating disorders, and that will significantly speed up recovery.</p>",

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

      "info_section_1_content": "<p>Mania is a temporary but extreme emotional high. It often occurs in individuals with bipolar disorder, but may also be prevalent in those suffering from depression. In bipolar disorder, manic episodes are offset by extreme emotional lows. As such, mania can be clearly recognized by people interacting with or observing the affected individual, but the individual may not recognize it in themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Mania is characterized by sudden and intense changes in mood, thought patterns, energy levels, and even self-esteem. These changes can cause an individual to engage in risky behaviors during a manic episode. Risky behaviors can put the individual&rsquo;s health at risk and are a major concern related to mania.</p>\r\n<p>Receiving treatment as soon as possible is essential in the management of mania. Manic episodes may worsen and lead to increasingly dangerous behaviors when left untreated.</p>",
      "info_section_2_title": "Signs of Mania",
      "info_section_2_content": "<p>If you have mania, the people around you will notice. This condition is mainly characterized by changes in mood, but there are other important symptoms, too:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mood swings</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mood swings are one of the most evident signs of mania. Someone experiencing mania may have intense excitability, inflated self-confidence, extreme friendliness or sociability, feelings of superiority, and unexpected changes to anger or irritability.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Erratic judgment</strong></p>\r\n<p>People experiencing a manic episode may have impaired judgement and make poor or risky decisions. This may involve making commitments that they can&rsquo;t keep, such as agreeing to new projects without the time or resources to complete them. Or, the individual may participate in risky activities like gambling, spending large amounts of money, or engaging sexual activity impulsively.</p>\r\n<p>Poor judgement during a manic episode can have long-lasting implications. For example, if an individual spend their entire life savings during a manic episode, they could experience financial hardship for years to come.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shifts in thought processes</strong></p>\r\n<p>Someone with mania may appear to think in a completely different way during an episode. The individual may have huge boosts in creativity and claim to have an epiphany (or several). Mania may also cause racing thoughts, a sudden fixation on religion, disorientation, or &ldquo;flight of ideas&rdquo;, which is a symptom commonly associated with bipolar disorder.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Changes in energy level</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mania usually causes sudden and extremely high energy levels. High energy can cause the individual to move constantly for no apparent reason and have a sudden interest in accomplishing goals (completing a project, for example). High energy levels can also lead to restlessness, talkativeness, an inability to sit still, and difficulty sleeping.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Psychosis</strong></p>\r\n<p>Severe cases of mania can cause symptoms of psychosis. This most commonly occurs in bipolar patients. Symptoms of psychosis include hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions.</p>",
      "info_section_3_title": "How is Mania Treated?",
      "info_section_3_content": "<p>There are two main treatment methods for mania: medications and psychotherapy. It&rsquo;s important to seek professional treatment as soon as possible when you recognize symptoms of mania. An individual with mania may not recognize the symptoms in their own behavior, so intervention of a friend or family member may be necessary.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Medications</strong></p>\r\n<p>Doctors often prescribe medications to treat mania, especially in patients with bipolar disorder.</p>\r\n<p>Lifestyle changes can accompany medications to reduce the risk of manic episodes. These include regular exercise, a balanced diet, a consistent sleep schedule, and limited caffeine intake.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong></p>\r\n<p>Psychotherapy to treat mania often involves cognitive behavioral therapy. This therapy method identifies the thought processes that lead to mania and related behaviors. It can help pinpoint triggering or troublesome thought patterns then gradually replace them with healthier thoughts and behaviors. Over time this method may reduce the chances of having a manic episode.</p>",

      "root_section_4_title": "WHEN TO SEE A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL",
      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

The onset of postpartum depression typically occurs during the first six weeks after childbirth.</p>\r\n<p>Postpartum depression is characterized by persistent sadness, lack of joy and satisfaction, and the apparent inability to take on the role of parent.</p>\r\n<p>Some experts believe that postpartum depression isn&rsquo;t a mental disorder per se, but the result of financial, social, and emotional insecurity that parents experience after childbirth.</p>\r\n<p>This means that by helping the mother overcome these anxieties &ndash; through solid emotional and even material support from friends and family &ndash; postpartum depression should be treatable and, relative to other mental health issues, easy to treat.</p>\r\n<p>However, in the absence of social support and professional help, postpartum depression can lead to a chronic form of depression.</p>",

      "info_section_3_content": "<p>When it comes to postpartum depression, prompt treatment is crucial for both mother and baby.

      "root_section_4_title": "WHEN TO SEE A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL",
      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

Having symptoms of postpartum depression is different than having postpartum depression. In addition, symptoms of postpartum depression can be caused by other mental health conditions, or other health problems, such as a thyroid problem. Only a trained professional, such as a doctor or a mental health provider, can make this determination. However, by printing the results and bringing it to a mental health professional, you can open up the conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>RECOMMENDED TREATMENT</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend <b>online counseling which can be very effective at treating Postpartum Depression.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online counseling allows you to receive care from a therapist via phone, video chat, or instant messaging. It can help address self-destructive behaviors, limiting beliefs, painful feelings, relationship issues, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is convenient for those who either cannot travel or would prefer not to meet with a therapist in-person. Ranging from $60 to $90 per week, it can also be more affordable than in-person counseling and is available worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Postpartum Depression is real, common, and treatable with online counseling. </b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\n</body></html>\n",

Internet Addiction Disorder impacts a large portion of the population in both the United States and Europe; studies have shown approximately 8.2% of the general population suffers from this condition.</p>\r\n<p>Internet Addiction Disorder has become a more widely accepted condition among medical professionals in recent years. With remarkable advancements in technology have come greater and more widespread fixation on the Internet. The Internet is practically omnipresent in many cultures around the world, making it more difficult to escape from the virtual world than it used to be. As a result, some people feel unable to control the amount of time that they spend on the Internet. Eventually, this may impact other areas of their lives and keep them from living a healthy, balanced life.</p>",

      "info_section_3_content": "<p>Internet Addiction treatment must start with a recognition of the trouble. People with Internet Addiction Disorder may struggle to identify that they have a problem. So, the intervention of a close friend or family member may be helpful.</p>\r\n<p>In minor cases of Internet Addiction, self-monitoring and self-correcting can be successful. There are online tools to help with this including apps or software to monitor time spent online and restrict websites that can be visited.</p>\r\n<p>Therapy is a common and often effective treatment option for different types of addiction, including Internet Addiction Disorder. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be successful for people with Internet Addiction because it focuses on replacing destructive habits with healthy ones. Over time, this treatment method may help people with Internet Addiction spend less time on the Internet and stop poor Internet habits, such as online gambling.</p>\r\n<p>Group therapy for Internet Addiction may help struggling individuals feel supported and motivated on the path to recovery. Group therapy can be especially helpful in people with Internet Addiction who feel isolated and/or struggle with in-person interactions.</p>\r\n<p>Internet Addiction Disorder may commonly be accompanied by conditions including depression, anxiety, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD, among others.

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

You should evaluate the impact of the internet on your life and address the problems directly caused by your internet usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These results do not mean that you have internet addiction disorder, but it may be time to start a conversation with a mental health professional. Finding the right treatment plan and working with your a healthcare provider can help you feel more like you again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Symptoms of Internet Addiction Disorder are often associated wth disorders such as Depression, ADHD, and Social Anxiety. We recommend you also take these screens that we have available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This screen is not meant to be a diagnosis. Diagnosis and care of mental health conditions can be difficult. Having symptoms of an internet addiction disorder is different than having an internet addiction disorder. In addition, symptoms of an internet addiction disorder can be caused by other mental health conditions, or other health problems. Only a trained professional, such as a doctor or a mental health provider, can make this determination.

While Job Burnout is not a medical diagnosis, it is a very real phenomenon which can seriously affect one's physical and mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can probably imagine, job burnout can impact our personal and professional life profoundly, leading to decreased job performance, relationship issues, and even medical complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand why job burnout can have a devastating impact on our everyday life, we need to look at its signs and symptoms.</p>",
      "info_section_2_title": "Signs of Job Burnout",
      "info_section_2_content": "<p>Job Burnout symptoms can vary in intensity and can include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lack of motivation</li>\r\n<li>Often thinking about how you should have a better job</li>\r\n<li>Lack of enthusiasm</li>\r\n<li>Feeling as if your job is pointless</li>\r\n<li>Resentment toward your coworkers</li>\r\n<li>Often feeling fatigued</li>\r\n<li>A significant decline in work performance</li>\r\n<li>Having little time or energy for hobbies</li>\r\n<li>Increased irritability</li>\r\n<li>Missing deadlines</li>\r\n<li>Frequently showing up late to work</li>\r\n<li>Frequently making simple mistakes at work</li>\r\n<li>Getting into conflicts with coworkers</li>\r\n<li>Feeling as if your job is pointless</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, symptoms of job burnout are mild at first. However, these symptoms are not likely to disappear on their own. If you try to ignore feelings of burnout without addressing it, it is most likely to get worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are experiencing job burnout know that you are not alone: Nearly two-thirds of workers reported feeling Job Burnout in a 2008 Gallup study.

This could take the form of short breaks, meditation, a day off, or a vacation. If you find yourself working extra at night, it will also be a good idea to prioritize sleep. People are more likely to experience burnout when they get few than six hours of sleep per night.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hobbies and Activities</strong></p>\r\n<p>Schedule something to do when the work day has ended. This will give you something to look forward to, as well as a plan for what to do after work. People who do not have anything to look forward to after work are more likely to experience burnout.</p>",

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

A toxic workplace may also involve an unhealthy atmosphere, or the work itself could have toxic effects. Characterized by high levels of drama, stress, confrontation, and a lack of communication, a toxic workplace can have a serious negative impact on the health of employees. Toxic workplaces often show poor productivity and the work of the organization suffers from the poor work environment.</p>\r\n<p>Toxic workplaces can vary greatly in the problems that they exhibit. For example, one company may show employees a lack of respect and demand unreasonable working hours, leading employees to be unhappy, gossip, and even call out sick more often. A different company may engage in illegal activity and exhibit verbal and physical violence in the workplace. Workplace dysfunction comes in all different forms and isn&rsquo;t always easy to recognize. But, when the health, wellness, and happiness of the employees are consistently compromised, it&rsquo;s reasonable to consider that you&rsquo;re working in a toxic workplace.</p>",
      "info_section_2_title": "Signs of a Toxic Workplace",
      "info_section_2_content": "<p>The main sign of a toxic workplace is consistent unhappiness and high stress levels among employees. Extreme stress and anxiety in the workplace can have severe health implications. Over time, anxiety, panic disorder, and depression may stem from working in a toxic environment. Your place of work is where you spend a large portion of your time during the week; therefore, a toxic workplace can have an overwhelmingly negative effect on your health.</p>\r\n<p>Stress can be spurred by other issues and poor practices within the office, including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Negative gossip between employees</li>\r\n<li>Leaders who frown upon suggestions or other opinions</li>\r\n<li>Leaders who don&rsquo;t foster growth among employees and/or value their long-term goals</li>\r\n<li>Employees feel voiceless and unable to express concerns</li>\r\n<li>Poor communication and transparency</li>\r\n<li>Disparities in rules and measurements of performance (promotions, work hours, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Fatigue and frequent sickness among employees</li>\r\n<li>More experienced employees aren&rsquo;t willing to work as hard as new hires</li>\r\n<li>When there&rsquo;s a pitfall, people shift blame onto others</li>\r\n<li>Underlying motivations other than the company&rsquo;s best interests (money, power, status, etc.)</li>\r\n<li>Lack of company pride or loyalty among employees</li>\r\n<li>No social support between employees</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "info_section_3_content": "<p>When you&rsquo;re working in a toxic workplace, coping strategies can be helpful to reduce stress and improve your quality of life. Try these tips to deal with working in a toxic atmosphere:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Consider the root of the problem. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Reflect on the main cause of toxicity in your workplace. Perhaps it&rsquo;s an individual in a leadership position who&rsquo;s abusing power or has too little experience. Or, your current coworkers may be unmotivated and unwilling to work hard. The issue may even involve the office itself - harsh lighting, cramped quarters, or run-down equipment can severely diminish your experience at work.</p>\r\n<p>If you can pinpoint a main issue in your workplace, consider if it&rsquo;s temporary or permanent. A temporary issue, like a leader who may soon be dismissed or an office that will soon be renovated, could be worth waiting it out. Knowing that the main cause of your stress and unhappiness will eventually disappear may help you cope with a toxic work environment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Seek out employees to connect with.</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re experiencing the impact of a toxic workplace, other employees certainly are, too. Connecting with your coworkers can help you relate to them and feel supported, which can make the workplace more tolerable.</p>\r\n<p>In a toxic workplace, some employees could be the problem. Look past these co-workers and seek out others who likely share your feelings. You don&rsquo;t have to share your concerns outright, but simply starting a conversation with coworkers is the first step towards building a support system at work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Keep an eye out for other opportunities.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Some toxic environments are simply intolerable on a long-term basis. If your workplace shows little hope of improving in the near future, make the pursuit of a different job a priority. Your job hunt can remain unknown by your coworkers and employers to avoid extra tension at work. Your next job should be a great opportunity and an improvement from your current position. It&rsquo;s likely not a wise decision to take anything that comes your way just to escape your present situation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Keep a work journal. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Journaling can be helpful for all aspects of your personal growth and emotional health. When you&rsquo;re working in a toxic environment every day, documenting your feelings and experiences is a helpful habit to implement. A work journal is also helpful for recording the projects that you work on, the sales you make, the phone calls you take, etc. Being hyper organized in prepared in a stressful work environment will work to your advantage when problems and discrepancies arise. By writing everything down, you may even be able to foresee an issue before it occurs.</p>",

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",

When panic &lsquo;hits,&rsquo; you may think you&rsquo;re losing your mind or that you may have a severe medical condition. People who experience panic attacks can sometimes feel like they are about to die.</p>\r\n<p>While most people will experience a panic attack at some point in their lives, some people experience them regularly. And that&rsquo;s when mental health professionals consider the possibility of a more severe condition &ndash; panic disorder.</p>\r\n<p>In essence, panic disorder is a form of anxiety disorder in which the patient displays recurring episodes of intense fear and anxiety, which trigger sudden and unexpected panic attacks.</p>",

      "root_section_4_content": "<p>Mental health issues are real, common, and treatable. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) 1 in 5 adults experience mental illness and 20% of those are considered serious. 17% of 6-17 year olds experience a mental health disorder. So the first thing to remember is this: You are not alone.</p><p>If you feel that you are suffering from a mental illness, and particularly if those issues are preventing you from living life to the full or feeling yourself, you may want to consider professional help which can make an enormous difference.</p><p>And to be clear, you don't need to be going through a crisis in order to justify getting help. In fact, it can be advantageous from a treatment perspective to identify and deal with issues early and before they have a major impact on your life. Either way you should feel encouraged and able to seek help however you are feeling.</p><p>Mental health professionals such as licensed therapist can help in a range of ways including:</p><ul><li>Help you identify where, when, and how issues arise</li><li>Develop coping strategies for specific symptoms and issues</li><li>Encourage resilience and self-management</li><li>Identify and change negative behaviors</li><li>Identify and encourage positive behaviors</li><li>Heal pain from past trauma</li><li>Figure out goals and waypoints</li><li>Build self-confidence</li></ul><p>Treatment for mental health issues, and psychotherapy (sometimes known as 'talk therapy') in particular, frequently helps people to feel better, manage, and even get rid of their symptoms. For example, did you know that over 80% of people treated for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/depression-test\" target=\"_blank\">depression</a> materially improve? Or that treatment for <a href=\"https://www.mind-diagnostics.org/panic_attacks_disorder-test\" target=\"_blank\">panic disorder</a> has a 90% success rate?</p><p>Other treatment options include medication which, in some cases, can be highly effective when administered in combination with psychotherapy.</p><p>So what is psychotherapy? It involves talking about your problems and concerns with a mental health professional. It can take lots of forms, including individual, group, couples and family sessions. Often, people see their therapists once a week for 50 minutes to start with and then reducing frequency as time goes on and issues subside. Treatment can be as short as a few weeks or as long as a few years depending on your particular situation and response.</p><p>Never think that getting help is a sign of weakness. It isn't. In fact, it can be a sign of strength and maturity to take the steps necessary to becoming you again and getting your life back on track.</p>",
